<h1>The Best Movies According to Fausto</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time:</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>An absolute classic. It never gets old whenever I rewatch it.</p>

<h3>Matilda</h3>
<p>Same as Shrek. An older movie but it never gets too old to watch.</p>

<h3>Batman: The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>
  A great movie. Especially when you have the greatest Joker performance in it.
